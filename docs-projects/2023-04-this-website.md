## Background & Motivation
I started this website in 2017 to showcase my undergraduate engineering projects and share some of my interests and background with the rest of the world. At the time, I was in my 2nd year of undergrad and heavily relied upon [this guide](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/) from Thomas Frank (one of my online role models at the time) to get the website up and running. Since then, it's undergone many iterations, which I've outlined below.
