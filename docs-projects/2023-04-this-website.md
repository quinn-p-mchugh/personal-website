## Background & Motivation
I started this website in 2017 to showcase my undergraduate engineering projects and share some of my interests and background with the rest of the world. At the time, I was in my 2nd year of undergrad and heavily relied upon [this guide](https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website/) from Thomas Frank (one of my online role models at the time) to get the website up and running. Since then, it's undergone many iterations, which I've outlined below.

### Late 2022
Shortly after learning of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) from a friend, I decided to migrate my website from a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) site hosted on [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/) to a Docusaurus site hosted (for free!) on [Vercel](https://vercel.app/). 

Why? While Wordpress + [Themify Builder](https://themify.me/builder) allowed me to create a half decent looking site, it cost $15 per month to host the site and there was a lot to be desired in terms of customization.
