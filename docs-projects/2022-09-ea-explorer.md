**EA Explorer is a network visualization of the [Effective Altruism (EA) Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), using post and tag data queried using the [EA Forum's GraphQL framework](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LJiGhpq8w4Badr5KJ/graphql-tutorial-for-lesswrong-and-effective-altruism-forum)**.

The goal of this project is to develop a tool to help individuals make sense of the diverse, complex, and evolving interests of those in the EA community and provide an alternative means for forum users to explore and discover EA content.

In the graph below, each node represents either a tag (from [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/all)) or a post ([example](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/B79ro5zkhndbBKRRX/p/ZhNaizQgYY9dXdQkM)). Connections between nodes indicate which tags apply to which posts and which posts are mentioned in other posts.
