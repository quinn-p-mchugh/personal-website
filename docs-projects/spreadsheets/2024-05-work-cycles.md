**"Work Cycles" is a method developed by [Ultraworking](https://ultraworking.com/) for achieving a highly focused and productive four hour work session.** After using the [original ""Work Cycles"" spreadsheet](https://www.ultraworking.com/resources#:~:text=Work%20Cycles%3A%20Work%20Cycles%20is%20a%20way%20to%20reliably%20have%20a%20highly%20focused%20and%20productive%20four%20hour%20work%20session.%20Included%20here%3A%20a%20spreadsheet%20generator%20that%20will%20make%20a%20copy%20of%20Work%20Cycles%20in%20your%20Google%20Drive%2C%20a%20written%20guide%2C%20and%20a%20video%20on%20how%20to%20use%20Work%20Cycles.) numerous times, I created a compact version (linked below). 

This version allows the whole "work cycles" process to be completed on a single page, making it easy to fill out, refer back to past work sessions, and identify patterns in my work habits.

I've found this spreadsheet to be an exceptionally useful tool for getting deep work done and helps me stay energized and on-task, especially when the things I'm working on aren't the most engaging.
