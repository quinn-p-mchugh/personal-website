Org charts, but in 3D: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8B1RefkoBM

Could use either:
- Rhino + grasshopper
- OpenSCAD + [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) + [openscad-wasm](https://github.com/openscad/openscad-wasm) - see https://openscad.cloud/ for demo on how to run OpenSCAD in cloud
- Create custom 3D environment with ThreeJS, BabylonJS, etc
- Whatever libraries these folks use: https://github.com/130oclock/3D-organizational-chart/tree/main
