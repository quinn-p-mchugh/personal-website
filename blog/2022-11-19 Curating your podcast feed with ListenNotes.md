**Have you ever been felt overwhelmed by your podcast feed?** Here's a screenshot of what mine looks like right now:

A little "all over the place", right?

Much of the content we peruse through in our everday lives is [noise](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/signal-noise-ratio/), podcasts include. In other words, the content might be entertaining, but it may not be *important* and *relevant* to our disciplines, projects, or goals.

In this informational post, **I will demonstrate how you might want to go about curating your podcast feed**, in order to make sure you're able to *find* and *actually listen* to podcasts and podcast episodes that are likely to yield relevant and important insights into the things you want to improve or achieve.

## Finding Podcasts

There are a number of great tools available for finding podcasts based on certain criteria. I have divded these up into two categories: technical and non-technical.

### Non-Technical

#### Browse a podcast social networks
**[Podyssey](https://podyssey.fm/)** and **[Podchaser](https://www.podchaser.com/)** are two social networks that are essentially [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/) but for podcasts.

#### Discover similar podcasts using [Rephonic Graph](https://rephonic.com/graph)
Rephonic is a podcast database that helps agencies and brands to find, qualify and pitch the right podcasts for any topic or niche. Fortunately for us, Rephonic has provided a 3D network graph to allow anyone on the Internet to discover related podcasts. The data for this project is provided from "Listeners Also Subscribed To" data from Apple Podcasts.

### Technical

#### Find episodes using an [ListenNotes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/)
[ListenNotes](https://www.listennotes.com/) is one of the best, if not the best, podcast search engine. While this database is often used by podcast**ers** as opposed to podcast **listeners**, you can use their Listen API to find podcasts episodes based on multiple criteria.
