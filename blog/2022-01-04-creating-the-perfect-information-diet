Address WHO you're targeting -- EAs who have been through an initial fellowship (with a curriculum) but are interested in continuing their education and learn about what kind of work/thoughts are being had in the cause areas they're interested in

WHY DO THIS?

There's are millions of pieces of content on line and a vast majority isn't important/relevant to you:

You can better understand what **actually** interests you.
