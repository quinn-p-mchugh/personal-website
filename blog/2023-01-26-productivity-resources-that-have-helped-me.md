What productivity hacks have worked for you?

Meta-comment: these discussion questions are making the think I should start a blog lol

There's a number of resources that have helped me streamline my workflows and understand how to better manage myself over the years. Here's some in order of impact:

How to use Gmail more efficiently | Andreas Klinger - This very old article has some sage, yet straightforward advice about blasting through a GMail inbox. Namely:
Using the Multiple Inboxes feature and some simple queries to sort emails into different buckets (e.g. Needs Action/Reply, Awaiting Reply, Scheduled, Delegated/Follow Up, Reference)
Enabling Auto-advance and using the shortcut } to quickly archive emails - if you're going to do anything to your GMail setup, this tiny change might be the greatest bang for your effort
Urgent & important: How (not) to do your to-do list - LessWrong
I found this post's commentary on the standard Eisenhower Matrix and its proposed upgrade to be useful and refreshing. In particular, I've found it much easier (i.e. less decision fatigue) to categorize tasks by whether you must, should, or could  (or perhaps wont) complete them v.s. categorizing them based on whether they're important and unimportant . The former acknowledges that "importance" comes in shades of gray, hence the designation between must and should.
Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time - It's easy to make the implicit assumption that while working on things, your energy will stay constant (e.g. have you ever stayed up until 1am doing a non-urgent thing, wondering why you're up so late? Me too :yawning_face:). This article explains why thinking about how best to manage your energy is a more useful thinking about how to manage your time.
In a similar vein: Do an Energy Audit
Getting Things Done (GTD) in 15 Minutes - Probably the most widely cited work management frameworks summarized in plain language.

There's probably more I could dig up, but in the interest of time, I'll stop here.
