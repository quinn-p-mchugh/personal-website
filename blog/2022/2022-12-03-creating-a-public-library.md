# Objective
This post provides some basic instructions for creating a [public Zotero library](./library) for sharing resources with friends, colleagues, and groups you're apart of.

# Motivation
Have you ever been in conversation with someone and said "*Oh! There's a couple articles I think you'd love. Let me email them to you.*"

Then, months later, you find yourself talking about the same subject with *different* person and end up digging *those same 10 articles* to send to them too?

If so, you've come to the right post.

Using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), a free & open source reference manager, let's learn how to alleviate this resource sharing calamity by creating our own public Zotero library. 

With a public Zotero library, you'll be able to create collections of resources you've found (including bibliographic information) and send just a *single URL* to the person you wish to share a set of articles with. From there, that person will be able to download those resources in a variety of formats, including CSV and JSON.

# Steps

## Creating your library
1. (If necessary) **[Create an account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/)** at zotero.org.
2. **[Log in](https://www.zotero.org/user/login/)** to your Zotero account.
3. **Navigate** to the **[Zotero Groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups/)** page.
4. **Create a new Zotero group**
	 1. Give your group a name (e.g. "Quinn McHugh [Public]")
	 2. Select **Public, Open Membership** for your Group Type
	 3. Make sure...
			1.  **Library Reading** is set to **Anyone on the internet**
			2.  **Library Editing** is set to **Only group admins**
5.  Go to "Group Settings" and update as you wish.
6.  Click the name of your group near the top of the page.
7.  Click "Group Library".
		- This is your public library. Anything you add here will be viewable and downloadable by others.
		- It should look something like mine: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4878976/quinn_mchugh_public/library

To add items to your newly created library, please see **[Adding Items to Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero)**.

### Sharing your library with others
To share your library, simply send the URL of your library to whoever you'd like. If you wish to send a specific collection, click on the collection in the left sidebar and send them that URL instead.

As of December 2022, Zotero online libraries *cannot* be embedded in websites using an HTML `<iframe>`.

Optionally, you can embed a list of recently added items using [BibBase](https://bibbase.org/) to give visitors a sense for what you've been interested in, as I have done [here](/library).
