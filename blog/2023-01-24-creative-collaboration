```js
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : [];
}
```

Where, when, or what are your most creative moments?
Anytime my brain is in idle mode (e.g. doing anything that's (1) not cognitively demanding and (2) not related to the problem - walking, showering, cooking, brushing teeth, etc)
When there's a deadline (mileage varies :sweat_smile:)
Where have you seen a team use creative problem solving to dramatically change an outcome?
In general...
Restricting scope 
Idea generation rates trend to skyrocket when asking "How might we do (X) by doing (Y)?" or "How might we do (X) with regard to (Z) domain?" instead of "How might we do (X)?" 
Creating a culture where ideas that seem impractical or stupid are not only accepted but embraced (i.e. the most terrible ideas often create the foundation on which great ideas are developed)  
More concretely, if a person suggests a seemingly terrible solution and you, as a facilitator, judge it as such, it (1) makes that person infinitely less likely to share ideas in the future and (2) sends a signal to everyone else in the session that "if I think my idea is not great, it will be rejected" - this is not a great strategy for spurring innovation
Instead, every idea, regardless of quality, should go on your Miro board, notes, or whatever you're using to document them. Just because a terrible idea gets written down doesn't mean it has to be selected. Text and canvas space are cheap, whereas having an unproductive session incredibly costly.
Structuring meetings to counteract the effect of social loafing
Example (which I love)
Have everyone come up with solutions entirely separately with a notebook of their choice
Come together as a team (no more than 3-5 people) and have everyone pass their notebook to the person next to them
Next person marks up notebook (comments, questions, concerns, additional ideas, modifications, etc.) and passes to the next person
Once notebook gets back to the author, everyone shares their ideas in addition to what was written by members of the team
Questioning assumptions
e.g. "If (X) were true, how would we approach this?" where (X) is some assumption that's unintuitive or even contrary to whatever assumptions/"rules of the game" you or your team think are at play
Outsourcing innovation (Prioritizing open innovation v.s. internal innovation)
It's silly to think that all of the best ideas will come from the 5-10 people on your team you've happened to hire. To solve really hard problems, find ways of outsourcing innovation to other companies, teams, or even the public.
