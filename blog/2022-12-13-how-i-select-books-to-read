## 

- All books go into my GoodReads "Want to Read" list
- I give a rating for the book based on how interested I am in reading the book.

You might want to choose a sorting algoirthm for determining what is the **most** important books to read in your life right now.

Questions to ask:
- Do I really, truly, & honestly care about this topic? 
- Is this book **important** and **relevant** to my life? 
- What do I hope to get out of this book? What areas of my life could it impact?
- What do I already know in relation to what the book is about?
- Am I going to read this book for fun/entertainment or out of discipline?
