## First Section

There are **three** different plugins available to sync

- While the officialy Obsidian plugin is great, it does not have the option to insert block references. This means that you will **not** be able to reference individual highlights/notes from other notes in your Obsidian vault (that is, without risk of overwriting them when your highlights are synced from Readwise another time). 
- The other two are hosted in GitHub: They are Readwise Community and Readwise Mirror
- Because of the block reference point above, I would recommend using Readwise Mirror


- Need to be careful when blocks - You want to make sure that if you actually do reference the highlight in another note via a block reference, the highlight will bring _your note_ about the highlight with it
