## Definitions
_Tacit Knowledge_ - Personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate or share such as beliefs, experience, or insights.
_Explicit Knowledge_ - Knowledge that can be codified using symbols such as words, numbers, and pictures.

## Why?
Setting up an effective system for documenting organizational knowledge

According to a [2023 report](https://www.grammarly.com/business/learn/communication-cost-infographic/) published by Grammarly and Harris Poll, knowledge workers spend a staggering **72%** of their workweek communicating with colleagues. In addition, poor communication costs US businesses an average of **$12,500** per employee each year. Assuming that some of this time, the time savings for creating and maintaining an effective knowledge management system can be substantial, let alone the positive effects to workers satisfaction and improved relationships with colleagues.

In addition, communications challenges do not get better on their own, but rather stagnate and worsen over time. Not investing in knowledge management infrastructure does not remove knowledge sharing issues, it exacerbates them.

## Why not?
There are a number of upkeep costs:
1. Initially documenting knowledge
2. Making changes
3. Approving changes
4. Deprecating old knowledge\

## My recommendation
I've come to realize that organizations should have **two** types of knowledge bases: one for **historical knowledge** that is likely to _become obsolete_ over time (i.e. meeting notes, decision documents, brainstorming archives, etc) and one for _curated_ knowledge (i.e. things that will be continually combed through and updated - team wikis, system diagrams, etc)

## Historical Knowledge
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) serves as great repository for historical knowledge that is likely to become obsolete over time. Why?

- Google Drive can serve all your documentation needs, whether it be a [Doc](https://docs.google.com/), [Sheet](http://sheets.google.com/), or [Slide](https://slides.google.com/). 
  - If you must, you can link to these documents in your curated knowledge base and still maintain its sanctity.
- Google Drive's search function is generally good, but finding content _inside_ poses a challenge. This makes it less suited as a knoledge base than other solutions.
