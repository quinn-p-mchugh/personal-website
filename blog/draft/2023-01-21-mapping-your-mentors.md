**Who are your role models?**

Most people answer their mom, dad, guardian, or someone else they personally know.

That's a good as answer as any, but I tend to think that our definition of role model should not be confined to people we personally know. To me, a role model is someone who:

- You do or don't know personally
- Is living or dead

We learn lots of things from other people. But what if we developed our _own_ network of the people that inspires us and their relation to things we're interested in?
