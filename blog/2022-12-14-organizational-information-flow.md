## Setting up notifications channels for your team in Slack
Confluence provides a means of subscribing to spaces, pages, or blog posts.

In order for your team to have a **shared** understanding of what changes are occuring that's relevant to your team/department, I recommend making a dedicated Slack channel for automatically receiving updates about a set of Confluence pages your team is interested in. That way, instead of telling newly onboarded people "subscribe to page A, B, and C" (which is prone to go out of date when new, relevant pages are made i.e. your team members might miss a particularly helpful/relevant resources that was created after they were onboardede), you can simply add them to the Slack channel and make it clear that "updates to this channel are important"
