In this post, I share the steps I took to declutter my inbox and make incoming emails significantly more manageable. 

## Prerequisites
To do this, you'll need:
- A GMail account - if you do not have a GMail account, some of the tips provided will still apply.

## Process Overview
1. Unsubscribe ruthlessly - Use a free tool to stop the flow of non-mandatory emails into your inbox, such as newsletters, promotions, and updates from sources you follow.
2. Star Your Important Emails - Use GMail's star feature and multiple inboxes to pin your most important emails to the top of your inbox.
2. Enable Email Bundling - Email bundling allows you to group similar emails to reduce the impact of context switching.
3. Clear Out Your Inbox - Either go through your email inbox or declare email bankruptcy
4. Monitor, Filter, and Label - Monitor your email inbox closely over the next couple of days. Create filters and labels to categorize any remaining emails and bundle them.
5. Review Unsubscribe Spreadsheet and Convert to RSS or Resubscribe - Incrementally review the newsletters you unsubscribed from and slowly reintroduce them to your inbox.
