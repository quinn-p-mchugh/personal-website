I've been using AntennaPod for years. Previously used Podcast Addict.

After doing an audit of my content curation practices, I've decided to pursue better alternatives.

My criteria for this search is the following. The podcast app...
- must have the ability to import **and** export OPML files
- should have cross platform syncing - specifically, the ability to listen to podcasts on desktop (via a Windows app or web app) and mobile (Android)
- should have an official or unofficial API (i.e. to query my podcast listening data in real-time)

The primary players in the Android podcast space are:
  - Podurama - No OPML export in web app, but has OPML import/export in Android app
  - Pocket Casts - Has everything (including [basic unofficial API](https://github.com/furgoose/Pocket-Casts)), but must have Pocket Casts Plus to access web player ($10/year is a fucking deal tho)
  - AntennaPod - FOSS, no web/desktop app :(
  - Podcast Republic - Web app UI is lacking
  - Podcast Addict
  - AntennaPod
  - Player FM - TBA
  - Castbox - TBA

Spotify, Google Podcasts don't support OPML :(

Podurama does not have Android widget :(
Really like the automatic categorization of differnet podcasts I'm subscribed to though
