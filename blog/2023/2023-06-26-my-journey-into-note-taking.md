*Click*. "File". "New". "Text Document". *Click*.

"3:33 PM 2/13/2017 - The day after my 20th birthday", I typed.

I created my first digital note. It was a plain text file for documenting each day of my life with a couple bullets. Write the time, date, 2-5 bullets. Done. It was dead simple.

At some point, I discovered the [Plain Text Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20230514191858/https://plaintextproject.online/articles.html), which inspired be to add some metadata to my precious note. I journaled in that text file on and off until September 29th, 2021. 

Enter OneNote. I was August 13th, 2018. My *Design for X* professor had assigned us to come up with a product idea to pitch to the class. I made a note in OneNote titled "Products" to brainstorm. I'll grace you with a few - "peanut butter cleaner tool", "a camera that literally looks like a potato", "electric flosser".

Through the subsequent months, this note would grow to include project ideas, book notes, and before I knew it, I was a passive OneNote user.

Fast forward to January 2020. I was a starry-eyed young professional working his first full-time job. There, I used OneNote to document some notes.

After being dissatisfied with OneNote's capabilities, I experimented with Notion for a few months.

In November 2021, I discovered Obsidian.
