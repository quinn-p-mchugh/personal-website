# My Library
At the link below, you'll find a curated library of resources I've saved that may be relevant to your interests or goals. This library is accessible to anyone on the Internet, so please feel free to share any resources you find with friends, colleagues, or groups you're apart of. For any risk-averse visitors of this page, don't worry - there shouldn't be any [info hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) here. ðŸ˜‰

**If there's a resource or collection of resources you think I'd be interested in, I'd love to hear from you.** Please [send me an email](./contact).

When viewing the library, press `Ctrl+F` and type a keyword of your choice to see if there are any collections on the left sidebar that might peak your interest.

**If you'd like to set one of these up yourself, I've outlined how in [this post](../../blog/2022/2022-12-03-creating-a-public-library.md)).**
