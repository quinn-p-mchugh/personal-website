    From [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about):
    > "*Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.*
    >
    > *Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.*
    >
    > *So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.*"

- **Seeking [new employment opportunities](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7160737757093392384/)** - I was laid off from my role at [FORT Robotics](https://www.fortrobotics.com/) in January 2024 and am actively seeking **technical operations** or **project management** roles where I can leverage my combined software development, process improvement, and project management experience to foster collaborative excellence, drive operational efficiency, and create meaningful impact within a high-performance, high-integrity team. Do you know of anyone I might want to talk to? I'd be grateful for for any leads, insights, or introductions!
- **Updating this website** - Although I've made a lot of incremental improvements to this website over the past year, I'm currently in the process of giving it a significant overhaul to enhance its content, functionality, and design. I'll eventually document the process over on my [project page](https://www.quinnmchugh.net/projects/this-website).
