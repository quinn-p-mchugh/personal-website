    From [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about):
    > Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
    >
    > Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
    >
    > So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.

- **Seeking [new employment opportunities](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7160737757093392384/)** - ideally, I'm looking to join a mid-size startup (100-1000 people) where I can serve as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders within a high-performing, high-integrity team. Do you know of anyone I might want to talk to? I'd be grateful for for any leads, insights, or introductions!
- **Updating this website** - this website is currently undergoing a major overhaul.
