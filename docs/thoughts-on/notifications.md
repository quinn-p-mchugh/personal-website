# Through your phone
Whenever you receive an actionable notification on your phone (e.g. a message from someone), don't click it unless you know you can reply to it in the next 5min. It is all too easy to look at the message and think "I'll reply to that later." In my experience, "later" usually means "far long after I've forgotten about it."
