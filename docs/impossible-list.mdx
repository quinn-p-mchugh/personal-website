An "impossible list", popularized by motivational blogger [Joel Runyon](http://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/), is a dynamic and ambitious list of goals and aspirations aiming to stretch the boundary of what one individual considers "possible" to achieve. While similar to a bucket list, an impossible list differs in its scope and ever-changing nature, focusing on personal growth, pushing one's perceived limits, and fighting back against [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

It's worth noting that some of the goals listed below are unrelated to my current endeavors. That's just due to the [path independent](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221) nature of life - while what I've done in the past and a myriad of socioeconomic factors undoubtedly influence the opportunities available to me today and the decisions I make tomorrow, they don't necessarily *determine* what I choose to pursue in the future (*insert caveat about free will*). Thus, the goals I set for myself in the past may not always align with the things I aspire to achieve today.

If you're looking to create your own impossible list, one thing to be weary of is "identity inertia" - the tendency for changeable identities you've assumed in the past (e.g. academic, artist, traveler, activist, non-technical person, etc) to dictate what you aspire to do in the future. I try to keep this in mind when selecting my own pursuits. Because of the hierarchical structure of this list, it's very easy to end up pursuing the "next highest goal" simply because you can, never stopping to consider whether it's really worth pursuing in the first place. This is both a strength and a weakness of this approach.
