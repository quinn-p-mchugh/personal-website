*This page was inspired by [this post](https://www.sambowman.co/p/things-i-recommend-you-buy-2020-sam-bowman) from Sam Bowman.*

This is a living document where I highlight some less obvious things I love using or that significantly improve my quality of life. I hope you find some useful recommendations here!

# Productivity
1. **A computer mouse with at [least 2 side buttons](./computer-mouse-with-two-side-buttons.png)**
	 - Allows you to easily navigate between previously visited browser pages (and other applications!) with your thumb.
		 - e.g. 
			 - 1st side button -> Go forward a page
			 - 2nd side button -> Go back a page
2. Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones (e.g. Bose QuietComforts)
	 - Great for listening to podcasts, articles, etc. on the go
	 - A must-have for commuting by train or trolley!

# Cooking
- A great chef's knife and pairing knife - I used an 10-inch [Victorinox](https://www.victorinox.com/us/en/Products/Cutlery/Chef%27s-Knives/c/CUT_ChefKnives) Fibrox Pro chef's knife and pairing knife, which I periodically sharpen using [this 3D printed sharpening system](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4135236)
- A rice cooker

# Health

## Sleep
1. **A well-fitted sleep mask**
		- The [Bucky 40 Blinks sleep mask](https://bucky.com/collections/sleep-eye-masks) has worked well for me. It fits my face well and doesn't provide
			- Face shapes differ, so YMMV.
			- I am blessed with being able to fall asleep quickly, so I am not too sensitive to small irritations.

## Nutrition
1. **[Soylent Meal Replacement Powder](https://soylent.com/products/soylent-powder-tub-cacao)** - I am the type of person that forgets to eat sometimes. Soylent provides a quick and easy way to provide the calories and nutrition my body needs.
	 - Although I do try to cook regular meals, Soylent helps supplement my meals when I'm either low on food or haven't had time to cook. 
	 - The best meal replacement powder depends depends largely on your individual needs. Choose one that satisfies your unique budget constraints and nutritional requirements.

## Mindfulness/Gratitude
- **A jar** to make into a [gratitude jar](https://blog.gratefulness.me/gratitude-jar/)

## Fitness/Mobility
- **A THICK (>0.5") yogo mat**
	- At the time of this writing, I am a pretty bony person. This means that during stretching, doing yoga, or other bodyweight exercises, I tend to put significant amount of pressure on the parts of my body that don't have a lot of flesh to cushion them. Ouch! Having a ~0.5" yoga mat solves this problem.
