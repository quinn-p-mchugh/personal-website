1. Find what you truly care about.
   - What's something wrong with the world that you can't stand?
   - e.g. "I hate when charities"
2. Find an organization where it is your responsibility to fix that problem.
   - Make sure the culture is in-line with your style
3. Systematize your job search (See the [2-hour job search](https://youtu.be/mvcXB_yYDkA))
