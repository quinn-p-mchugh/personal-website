Human bias and algorithmic bias are two sides of the same coin. Humans produce bullshit from baked-in biases, heuristics, and ideology, whereas algorithms produce bullshit based on biased training data. Both possess an inaccurate model of the world to varying degrees.

Thus, instead of asking adverserial questions like "is human or algorithmic decision-making better?"

We should ask: "how transparent are our democratic decision-making processes and how well are they serving us?"
