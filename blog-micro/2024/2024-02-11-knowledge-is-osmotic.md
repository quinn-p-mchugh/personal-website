I've been reading _[The Smart Mission: NASA's Lessons for Managing Knowledge, People, and Projects](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59572181-the-smart-mission)_ by Ed Hoffman, Matt Kohut, and Larry Prusak and one of the key concepts is the highly social nature of knowledge. People often confuse knowledge with information, believing that knowledge can be reliably captured, managed, and controlled simply by writing things down or communicating certain things to certain individuals.

**In reality, knowledge is osmotic** - it's an intangible, renewable resource that flows variably from one entity to the next. Sometimes, this flow can be frustratingly slow. Other times, it can be astonishingly quick. And while the flow of knowledge is unable to be directly controlled, leaders who understand how to incentivize knowledge sharing and influence the direction and magnitude of this flow can break down knowledge silos and help create environments of collaborative innovation.
