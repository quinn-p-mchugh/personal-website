One thing I wish was a norm: question first, context second

When requesting information from someone, compose your message with your question first and provide context underneath.

For example: 
> "Hey Quinn, do you have a sense for how far along we are in finishing (X) project?
> 
> I have a meeting this Tuesday where I'll need to report on our project progress. So, I was hoping to better understand the project is coming along and what kinds of challenges you might be experiencing."

Why provide context? Because sometimes, the question you ask might not be the right one. By asking the question first and providing context after, you give the person you're communicating with all the information they need to give you a comprehensive answer.
