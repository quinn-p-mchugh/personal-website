#TIL about [Democracy Technologies](https://democracy-technologies.org/), a magazine of the [Innovation Politics Institute](https://innovationinpolitics.eu/).

**They offer:**
1. An impressive [database of tools](https://democracy-technologies.org/database/) to support participatory decision-making, including [Polis](https://democracy-technologies.org/product/polis/), [Decidim](https://democracy-technologies.org/product/decidim/), and [Loomio](https://democracy-technologies.org/product/loomio/)
2. [Introductory articles on concepts relating to digital democracy](https://democracy-technologies.org/getting-started/)
3. [News, case studies, guides, and other resources related to innovations in democratic technology](https://democracy-technologies.org/industry-news/)
...and more!

While many of these technologies are designed primarily for use by government & municipal entities, I'd argue they offer substantial value to any companies or non-profits looking to increase their decision-making effectiveness and capacity to innovate. With the ability to gather, aggregate, and make sense of qualitative feedback in a fraction of the time and cost of running traditional surveys, organizations willing to explore the potential of these cutting-edge tools stand to foster a culture of collaborative innovation, boost employee engagement, and stay resilient to disruption in an increasingly complex world.
