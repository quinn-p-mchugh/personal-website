One aspect of hiring/interviewing I've been thinking about:

I have a hunch that hiring processes tend to focus more on a candidate's *depth* of knowledge in a select number of areas than the total questionably relevant *breadth* of knowledge they possess.

This makes sense because it's a form of measurability bias - it's hard to assess skills and experience that don't seem relevant to the immediate role being hired for, but that seemingly irrelevant blend of expertise could be the thing that enables that candidate to have outsized impact relative to other candidates. You can think of a candidate's breadth of knowledge can be an loose proxy for level of creativity and capacity to innovate. It's easier to produce good ideas when you have a lot of other ideas (from both similar and dissimilar domains) to take inspiration from.

This doesn't apply to all roles, of course, but I do think it's something worth thinking about.
