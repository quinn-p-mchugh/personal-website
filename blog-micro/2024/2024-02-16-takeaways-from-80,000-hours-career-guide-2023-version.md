I've been listening to the 80,000 Hours Career Guide (updated Sept 2023), a guide I first engaged with as a bright-eyed undergraduate student in 2018. It's been a great resource for brushing up on what makes a fulfilling career, common misconceptions about career decisions, and options to consider as I take the next step in my professional journey.

While the guide is absolutely worth reading or listening to in full, I wanted to write some of my takeaways, in case it'd be valuable, informed by my own thinking and experiences as it relates to my career:
- [Components of a fulfilling career contrasted with CAMPS model]
- You're bad at understanding what career you'd be best at - Learn by Doing, don't learn by thinking/reflecting
- Cause-first v.s. career-capital-first approach to career progression
