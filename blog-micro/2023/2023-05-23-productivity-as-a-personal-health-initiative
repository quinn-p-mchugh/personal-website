Creating a productivity system that works for your unique life situation can yield numerous of benefits.

Benefits such as:
- Reduced mental load
- Reduced decision fatigue
- Improved meta-attention

However, I think it's easy to assume these benefits are valuable *because* they help increase your individual capacity (i.e. they help you "get more stuff done").

To me, these benefits are not only  valuable in this way but *also* because reducing the amount of things your brain has to remember and keep track of is valuable in and of itself.

In other words, an overloaded, overworked brain is not a healthy brain.

Your brain is a muscle. Remember that.
