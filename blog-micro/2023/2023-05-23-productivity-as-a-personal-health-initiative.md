Creating a productivity system that works for your unique life situation can yield numerous of benefits.

Benefits such as:
- Reduced [mental load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)
- Reduced [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)
- Improved [meta-attention](https://dictionary.apa.org/meta-attention)

However, it's too easy to view these systems purely as mechanisms to boost your productivity. That is, viewing them as valuable because they help you "get more stuff done".

**To me, these systems aren't only valuable because they increase your individual capacity - they also play an integral role in preserving your cognitive health.** Reducing the clutter your mind has to remember and keep track of is not just a strategy for staying organized; it's a way to care for your brain.

A brain drowning in information is not a healthy brain.

Consider your brain as a muscle. Over-exertion and continuous strain can lead to fatigue and damage, impairing its long-term functionality. So, as you exercise your body for physical health, remember to care for your mental muscle too - it's equally vital, if not more.
